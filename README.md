The Spark Streaming Homework was designed to provide me with a deeper understanding of streaming processes and how to work with them within the Databricks platform.
Through this assignment, I gained more experience with streaming solutions and become more familiar with the key concepts of Spark Streaming applications.
By the end of the homework, I have acquired knowledge of execution, monitoring, and managing streaming applications, which will be valuable for developing robust and scalable streaming solutions.
